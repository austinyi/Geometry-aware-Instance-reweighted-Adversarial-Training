# Geometry-aware-Instance-reweighted-Adversarial-Training

This repository provides codes for geometry-aware instance-reweighted adversarial training methods,
based on the paper **Geometry-aware Instance-reweighted Adversarial Training**

## What is the nature of adversarial training?
Adversarial training employs adversarial data for updating the models. 
For more details of the nature of adversarial training, refer to this [FAT's GitHub](https://github.com/zjfheart/Friendly-Adversarial-Training) for the preliminary. <br/> 
In this repo, you will know: 
## Model Capacity is NOT enough for adversarial training.

## Data are inherently different. 
More attackable/guarded data are closer to/farther away from the decision boundary.

## Given the limited model capacity, we should treat adversarial data differently for updating the model.
